# HTML/CSS/JavaScript
To build a functional static webpage, it is necessary to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) defines the structure of webpage, [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css) adds styles, and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript) makes the page interactive.
