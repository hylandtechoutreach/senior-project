## Schedule
- Week 1: Self-paced learning / Software development project work
- Week 2: Software development project work

## Software Development Project
Students should build a web application. This could be a static website with HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a full-stack web app with Node.js and Express.

Students can begin by doing some self-paced learning, or they can jump right into building something. The ultimate goal is to have a complete web app of some sort by the end of the project.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is the recommended development environment for the project.
