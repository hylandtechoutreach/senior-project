## Schedule
The first week of the experience will mostly be focused on learning. The second week will be focused on project work. Our goal is for this to be a student-driven experience, so please feel free to change direction as necessary.

### Week 1
- Icebreaker activities (daily)
- Mini-lesson on the Command Line (day 1)
- Mini-lesson on Git (day 3)
- Self-paced learning OR project work (throughout)
- **Students should have a project idea by the end of the week**

### Week 2
- Project work
- Guest Speakers (throughout the week)
- **Project presentations on the last day**

## Software Development Project
Students should build a web application. This could be a static website with HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a full-stack web app with Node.js and Express.

Students can begin by doing some self-paced learning, or they can jump right into building something. The ultimate goal is to have a complete web app of some sort by the end of the project.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is the recommended development environment for the project.
