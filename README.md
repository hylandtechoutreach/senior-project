## Schedule
- Week 1: Self-paced learning / Hackathon work
- Week 2: Hackathon work

## Hackathon Project
Students should build a web application. This could be a static website with HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a full-stack web app with Node.js and Express.

Students can begin by doing some self-paced learning, or they can jump right into building something. The ultimate goal is to have a complete web app of some sort by the end of the project.

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript

#### Self-Paced Learning
- [MDN Tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [Web 102 Hy-Tech Club Curriculum](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-102)

#### Examples
These are all possible to build using front-end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

- [Monster Adventure](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-102/Week11/MonsterAdventure.html)
- [Which Season Are You?](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-102/Week11/PersonalityQuiz.html)
- [Which Pet Are You?](https://mchiricohyland.github.io/web102finalproject)

### Full-Stack Web Development

#### Self-Paced Learning
- [Web 201 Hy-Tech Club Curriculum](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-201)

#### Examples
With a full-stack web app, the possibilities are almost endless. This [simple CRUD app](https://infinite-spire-85843.herokuapp.com/) may not do anything too special, but the concepts can be extended to build a whole lot more.

Here are some options:
- To-Do List Application
- Recipe Application
- Blog Application
- Marketplace Application (e.g. craigslist)
- Social Media Application (e.g. Twitter)
- Movie Review Application (e.g. Letterboxd)
