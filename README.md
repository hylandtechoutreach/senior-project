## Schedule
- Week 1: Self-paced learning / Software development project work
- Week 2: Software development project work

## Software Development Project
Students should build a web application. This could be a static website with HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a full-stack web app with Node.js and Express.

Students can begin by doing some self-paced learning, or they can jump right into building something. The ultimate goal is to have a complete web app of some sort by the end of the project.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is the recommended development environment for the project.

### Option 1: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
To build a functional static webpage, it is necessary to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) defines the structure of webpage, [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css) adds styles, and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript) makes the page interactive.

#### Self-Paced Learning
There are several ways to begin learning the basics of web development. W3Schools has tutorials for [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp), and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp). For a more technical introduction, MDN has [tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) as well. There are many other tutorials available, so feel free to search the internet to find the one that works best!

#### Project Ideas
There are several possible projects that use front-end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are some examples:

- [Coolness Calculator](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-102/Week11/CoolnessCalculator.html)
- [Monster Adventure](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-102/Week11/MonsterAdventure.html)
- [Which Season Are You?](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-102/Week11/PersonalityQuiz.html)
- [Which Pet Are You?](https://mchiricohyland.github.io/web102finalproject)

### Option 2: Full-Stack Web Development
To build a fully-fledged web application, it is necessary to use a full stack. This allows for a server and database, so the app can keep track of data and serve up different pages dynamically.

#### Self-Paced Learning with Hy-Tech Club
The recommended path for a full-stack web development project is to follow the [Web 201 Hy-Tech Club Curriculum](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-201). This curriculum uses the following technologies:

- Node.js/Express (server)
- npm (package manager)
- EJS (front-end templating)
- MySQL (database)

Many different technologies are available for each part of the full "stack." Feel free to experiment with a different technology if desired.

#### Project Ideas
With a full-stack web app, the possibilities are almost endless. This [simple CRUD app](https://infinite-spire-85843.herokuapp.com/) may not do anything too special, but the concepts can be extended to build a whole lot more.

Check out this [description](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-201/FinalProject/FinalProject.html) for the full-stack web development project. 

Here are some ideas:
- To-Do List Application
- Recipe Application
- Blog Application
- Marketplace Application (e.g. craigslist)
- Social Media Application (e.g. Twitter)
- Movie Review Application (e.g. Letterboxd)
