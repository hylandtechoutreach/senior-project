# Option 2: Full-Stack Web Development
To build a fully-fledged web application, it is necessary to use a full stack. This allows for a server and database, so the app can keep track of data and serve up different pages dynamically.

## Self-Paced Learning with Hy-Tech Club
The recommended path for a full-stack web development project is to follow the [Web 201 Hy-Tech Club Curriculum](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-201). This curriculum uses the following technologies:

- Node.js/Express (server)
- npm (package manager)
- EJS (front-end templating)
- MySQL (database)

Many different technologies are available for each part of the full "stack." Feel free to experiment with a different technology if desired.

## Project Ideas
With a full-stack web app, the possibilities are almost endless. This [simple CRUD app](https://infinite-spire-85843.herokuapp.com/) may not do anything too special, but the concepts can be extended to build a whole lot more.

Check out this [description](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-201/FinalProject/FinalProject.html) for the full-stack web development project. 

Here are some ideas:
- To-Do List Application
- Recipe Application
- Blog Application
- Marketplace Application (e.g. craigslist)
- Social Media Application (e.g. Twitter)
- Movie Review Application (e.g. Letterboxd)
